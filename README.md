**Objective**

To establish the usefulness of explainable AI (XAI) methods for Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. This case-study was done as part of the paper "Bridging AI and Health on Time Series Analysis and Explainability Using the Case Study of EEG Channel Selection Problem" for submission in AAAI25 workshop W31: Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications.
